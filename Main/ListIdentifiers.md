Three menu options for lists of identifiers are available. Activating one of these options will show a standard file-identification interface. Required is a formatted input file with one line per entry, and the star identification number being the only data to appear in the first 7 character positions. Any record not fitting this description will be ignored. Any amount of data can follow, but will be ignored. The identifiers can be either Hipparcos, HD or HR numbers. All lists are transformed to Hipparcos numbers, and any HD or HR number not contained in the Hipparcos catalogue will be ignored. After ingesting the list of numbers, the [Output Options][2] window is shown.
