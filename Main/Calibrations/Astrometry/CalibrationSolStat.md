This section shows a few examples of error distributions for the new reduction. The first chart shows the normalized standard error distribution for all implemented orbits. The distributions, which have not been artificially adjusted, are to a high degree Gaussian throughout the mission.

The second chart shows the distribution of positional errors on the field transits. These errors are photon-noise dominated, and depend therefore on the intensity of the source and the total integration time for the transit. These are the errors that have been propagated, without further corrections or adjustments, to the astrometric solutions.
