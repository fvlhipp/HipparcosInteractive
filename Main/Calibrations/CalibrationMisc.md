The main interest for the miscellaneous calibrations stems from the information they provide on short and long term temperature and structural changes of the satellite. In particular the [on-board clock drift][3] showed how the spacecraft reacted on variations in solar radiation, as caused by the ellipticity of the Earth orbit and as due to solar eclipses. 

The gyroscope drifts also showed [temperature dependencies][5], as well as dependencies on the [rotation phase][4] of the satellite (gyroscope harmonics). The [gyroscope transformations][6], showing the sensitivities to rates on the payload axes, shows some peculiarities, such as a noticeable change in the transformations when a fourth, redundant, gyroscope was activated. [The gyroscope noise correlations][7] is a record of performance of the gyroscopes in general.
