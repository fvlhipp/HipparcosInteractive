The astrometric calibrations cover two domains, the large-scale distortions, referred to as the [Instrument model][3], and the [medium and small scale distortions][6]. The first are determined once every orbit, the second once over the mission. Also shown are the [solution statistics][4] for the instrument model in the form of the distribution of standard errors.
