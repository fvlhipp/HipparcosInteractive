Noise characteristics for the active gyroscopes differed greatly, with at some point differences in noise level of a factor 10. As the gyroscopes were part of the on-board attitude control, this indirectly affected the accuracy of the on-board attitude and the centring of the IDT on the images. However, this was still all well within reasonable margins, and has not affected the data quality.

The noise-correlation pattern is a reflection of how accurate the readouts have been for these rate-integrating gyroscopes, where the input axis position is corrected for the readout value on a time scale of about 1 to 2 seconds.
