The star mapper calibrations are important for understanding the Tycho astrometric and photometric data. They also performed a crucial role in the data processing for the Hipparcos data, as the star mapper data were the only source for the across-scan attitude reconstruction, and provided a first approximation of the background level used in the [IDT photometry][3]. 

The following calibrations can be accessed:

- [Geometric calibration][4]
- [Residual distributions][5]
- [Photometric calibrations][6]
- [Background reconstruction][7] (all mission or single orbit)
- [Single-slit response functions][8]
