![Summary information][fig31]

There are currently 7 different identifiers for individual sources implemented:

1.  Hipparcos number 
2.  Tycho-catalogue identifier 
2.  HD number (Henry Draper catalogue and extension)
3.  HR number (Bright star catalogue)
4.  Bayer/Flamsteed identifier
5.  Variable star identifier
6.  Common name

Entries 2 to 7 will be filled in where data is available. The HD, HR and Bayer/Flamsteed cross references are as in [SP-1200][1]. The Variable stars references and common names had a small number of new entries added. Tycho identifiers are based on the [Tycho-2 catalogue][3].
