![beta Lyr light curve][fig39]

For periodic or semi-periodic variables a folded light curve is provided, showing both the H<sub>dc</sub> and H<sub>ac</sub> magnitudes. The period and zero point used are those referred to in the variability summary on the [Photometric Summary][1] tab. The figure above shows the folded Hipparcos observations for &beta; Lyr, HIP 92420.
