3. [Geneva] [3], [Str&#246;mgren] [4] and [Walraven] [5] photometry;
4. spectroscopic data as presented in [SP-1200] [1], extended with the [5th survey by Houk and Swift, 1999] [6];
5. miscellaneous updates to photometric indices and spectra.

All data files are contained in the data folder. Identifying the position of the data folder is done when the software is first run, or when the menu item *Data Location* is called. Also identified at this stage is a default location (folder or equivalent) for output files, such as PDF files of charts.
