Through the output dialogue the user can define the data contents of an ASCII output file for a selection of stars, as can be defined through the [List][2] menu or from selections in the [Photometry][1] section. The output dialogue comes in the form of a window with 5 tabs for different types of contents:

- [Identifiers][3]
- [Astrometric data][4]
- [Photometric data][5]
- [Miscellaneous data][6]
- [Output format][7]

When all required data fields have been checked, push the **Output File** button. This will open a file-specification dialogue. With the file name and destination folder set, the button **Accept and Close** appears, and can be pushed to conclude the process. When the file is ready, the **Selection Output Data** dialogue disappears. The formats for all the fields that can be included are specified [here][8].
