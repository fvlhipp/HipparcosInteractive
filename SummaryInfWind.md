The Summary Information window provides the astrometric and photometric data for an individual source, which has been identified either by one of the identifiers on the [Single stars][1] tab, or as a data point of interest on one of the charts or maps. The summary information window has the following tabs:

- [Identifiers][3]
- [Astrometric summary][4]
	- Orbit (if applicable)
- [Photometric summary][5]
	- Epoch photometry
- [Light curve][6] (for periodic variables)

<h3 id="pdfinfo"> The pdf information sheet </h3>
The pdf information sheet is obtained by pushing the button [Pdfsummary][7], and provides a hard-copy output of the data and charts shown in the Summary Information window. The output folder for the information sheet can be set, and is by default the folder identified for outputs as initialized.
